# Code of Conduct

## Principles

1. **KISS - Keep it simple stupid**

- Strive for simplicity in your code and solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

2. **Don’t re-invent the wheel**

- Utilize existing solutions and libraries when possible. Avoid duplicating functionality that already exists.

3. **Rule of 3**

- The first time, don’t make it generic. The second time, maybe. The third time you probably should. This helps in avoiding premature optimization and over-engineering.

4. **Boy Scout Rule**

- Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it. Ensure that you leave the codebase in a better state than when you started working on it.

By adhering to these principles, we can maintain a high standard of code quality and collaboration.

Thank you for your cooperation!
